All the resources and conText a new conScript needs, smushed together
into a single doc.

## Welcome

Welcome to the [Center for Open
Neuroscience](https://centerforopenneuroscience.org/), where we are
working together to make Neuroscience a better science!

We do that by developing standards, workflows, tools, and automation
that improve the effieniency, transparency, and reproducibility of the
next generation of Neuroscience.

## Employees

If you are a new employee of the Center for Open Neuroscience, see

## The Ecosystem

There as a LOT of things to know! We've got a handy [definitions
page](definitions.md)
that briefly introduces acronyms, projects, and more with links.

## The Vision

Here are a few resources that can help to understand how the projects
fit together into the Open Neuroscience ecosystem.
