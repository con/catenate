# Con/boarding

This pages is intended for new employees of the Center for Open Neuroscience.
Please note that some of the following links and resources are not publicly accessible.

## Accounts

### GitHub

Ask Yarik to add you to the [CON Org](https://github.com/con).

#### Conventions

1. Use `https` instead of `ssh` for git remotes to make the configuration
   more portable. You can switch to `ssh` for pushing by appending to your
   `~/.gitconfig`

   ```
   [url "git@github.com:"]
      pushinsteadOf = https://github.com/
      pushinsteadOf = http://github.com/
   [url "git@gitlab.com:"]
      pushInsteadOf = https://gitlab.com/
   [url "git@bitbucket.org:"]
      pushinsteadOf = https://bitbucket.org/
   ```
1. While you are modifying .gitconfig you might consider setting your
   default branch as well.

```
[init]
   defaultBranch = main
```

### Chat clients

CON does not currently have a centralized IM infrastructure, there are however a number of per-project channels.

0. CON-internal: by invitation (ask a colleague for the URL) after registering on matrix.io.
1. DANDI slack workspace: registration comes with registering a user on https://dandiarchive.org. Then user needs to be invited to "internal" room.
2. ReproNIM slack workspace (ask Yarik)
3. DataLad matrix.io: [public room](https://matrix.to/#/#datalad:matrix.org), [internal](not-sure-if-not-private)
4. [NWB slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/nwb-users/shared_invite/enQtNzMwOTcwNzQ2MDM5LWMyZDUwODJjYjM3MzMzYzZiNDk4ZTU3ZjQ3MmMxMmY5MDUyNzc0ZDI5ZjViYmJjYTQ5NjljOGFjZmMwOGIwZmQ)
5. [mattermost brainhack](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/): for various open science projects

### Compute

What are the appropriate uses of each box?
How much does it cost to run things?


1. Send desired login name and .pub portion of the SSH key to Yarik for development box(es): smaug, typhon, etc
   1. login to `smaug`: `ssh -i /path/to/key me@smaug.dartmouth.edu -p
      $SOME_PORT`
   1. login to `typhon`: `ssh -i /path/to/key me@typhon.dartmouth.edu -p
      $SOME_PORT`
      Note: When logging in from campus (use `eduroam`), SSH does not always work on
      `typhon`. Instead it is recommended to use `ssh-agent` and forward the authentication connection using `-A`
         1. (Assuming `ssh-agent` is running) `ssh-add -t 3600 /path/to/key`
         1. `ssh-add -l` should now show your fingerprint.
         1. SSH into `smaug` with connection forwarding: `ssh -A me@smaug.dartmouth.edu -p $SOME_PORT`
         1. Once on `smaug` `ssh-add -l` should now show the same fingerprint.
         1. From `smaug`, proceed to `typhon` with `ssh me@typhon.dartmouth.edu -p $SOME_PORT`
   1. You might benefit from specifying some details within your
      `~/.ssh/config` for the given host(s):
         1. `SOME_PORT` so you don't need to enter it every time
         1. `ForwardAgent` is equivalent to `-A`
         1. `ProxyJump` allows you to jump automatically.

      ```
      Host smaug smaug.dartmouth.edu drogon drogon.dartmouth.edu typhon typhon.dartmouth.edu
         Port $SOME_PORT
         ForwardAgent yes

      Host typhon typhon.dartmouth.edu
         ProxyJump smaug.dartmouth.edu
      ```
      With this ssh config in place, `ssh typhon.dartmouth.edu` would
      jump you over through `smaug`.
   1. If you need to use MacOS, ask Yarik to add your key to the Con Mac.
      Then you can add to your ssh config in `smaug` and login from there.
      ```
      Host conmac
        Hostname datalads-imac2.kiewit.dartmouth.edu
        AddKeysToAgent yes
        port 2223
        user yoh
      ```


2. Get an account for the Discovery Cluster at Dartmouth and set up remote access to it
   1. [Apply for Discovery Account](https://rcweb.dartmouth.edu/accounts/index.php)
   2. The Discovery Cluster can be accessed off campus either via VPN or ProxyJump through ssh.
      1. To set up VPN, please visit [the Services Portal](https://services.dartmouth.edu/TDClient/1806/Portal/KB/?CategoryID=17668) for info.
      2. To set up ProxyJump through ssh, you must already have ssh access to a server on campus.
         * For example, if you already have ssh access to our server `Smaug`, you can set up ProxyJump by adding the following to your `~/.ssh/config` file:
         ```
            Host smaug smaug.dartmouth.edu
                Hostname smaug.dartmouth.edu
                AddKeysToAgent yes
                IdentityFile <path to your private key>
                port <ssh port for Smaug>
                user <your username>

            Host discovery discovery.dartmouth.edu
                HostName discovery.dartmouth.edu
                PreferredAuthentications gssapi-with-mic,hostbased,keyboard-interactive,password
                ProxyJump smaug.dartmouth.edu
                ServerAliveInterval 30
                user <your user name at discovery>
         ```
   3. More information regarding the Discovery Cluster can be found at [its documentation](https://services.dartmouth.edu/TDClient/1806/Portal/KB/?CategoryID=21663)
      at Services Portal, [Dartmouth Brain Imaging Center Handbook](https://dbic-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discovery.html),
      and [John Hudson's course notes](https://rcweb.dartmouth.edu/~john/HPC/).
   4. Request `rc-DBIC` group from Yarik. (Necessary to use Datalad) Be sure to follow this guide to use DBIC-installed git-annex. https://dbic-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mri/dataaccess.html#discovery-filesystem

3. VNC is available on some of our servers

   To find out if a server provides VNC, try running `vncserver --version`. If the
   command returns information about a VNC server, VNC is available on the server.
   Once you have access to a server with VNC available, you can use VNC to access a
   desktop environment on the server by following these steps:
   1. Run `vncpasswd` to set a password to used for logging into VNC
      sessions (`man vncpasswd` for details)

      ```vncpasswd```
   2. Run `vncserver` to start a TigerVNC desktop session (`man vncserver` for details)

      ```vncserver```

      The started desktop session will be assigned an X display number that will be
      indicated in the output of the `vncserver` command.
   3. Each session is assigned a particular port number for network access. The port
      number is the X display number plus 5900. For example, if the X display number is
      1, the port number will be 5901. Running `vncserver -list` will show the X display
      number and port number for each existing VNC session.
   4. To connect to the VNC session from your local machine, you will need a VNC client.

      If are using `xtightvncviewer` which has builtin SSH tunneling, you can connect to
      a VNC session directly.

      ```xtightvncviewer -via <username>@<server name>.dartmouth.edu localhost:<VNC assigned port number>```

      If you are using a VNC client that does not have builtin SSH tunneling, you will
      need to create an SSH tunnel to the VNC server and then connect to the VNC session
      through the tunnel.

      1. Create an SSH tunnel to the VNC server

         ```ssh -L <local port number>:localhost:<VNC assigned port number> <username>@<server name>.dartmouth.edu```

      2. Connect to the VNC session through the SSH tunnel using the VNC client on your
         local machine at `localhost:<local port number>`

      Where `<VNC assigned port number>` is the port number assigned to the VNC session
      on the server and `<local port number>` is the port number on your local machine
      that you want to use for the SSH tunnel. `<server name>` is the name of the server
      where the VNC session is running.
